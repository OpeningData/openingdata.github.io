					<strong style="color: black;">What is Opening Data?</strong> 
					<br/> 
				    What do you think when you hear the term <i>open</i> data? Likely, transparency, accountability, democracy — words that imply the operation of some organization or social structure are documented in a public way. But what do organizations actually mean when they say their data is <i>open</i>? That they have a tidy .csv file downloadable to anyone who wants it? But how many people can translate that raw data into answers? And if you have never heard of a .csv file before, thats totally understandable – you already prove our point. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    We at Opening Data find a disconnect between the connotations of <i>open</i> and its reality. We are custodians of data that already belongs to the public, opening it up through visual methods to transform <i>open</i> into accessible. Through this platform, we invite you to play with data you already own to uncover insights you have a right to know. Sometimes we progress further through the analysis process, drawing specific conclusions about public-interest issues. But often we simply present an accessible interface for important data sets, leaving the discovery to you. Along the way, we explain why we made specific analytic decisions and include some tips for you at home to investigate issues of importance to you too. So join us as we open up the world of data.
